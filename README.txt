Accept XRP, EUR, USD, BTC & ETH, using a single plugin with the greatest XRP ledger client (wallet): Xaman (formerly Xumm)!

== Description ==

Allow easy on ledger, non custodial XRP ledger payments, in XRP or IOU's (issued currencies).

XRP transactions are usually user initiated: open your wallet, enter the destination, amount, etc. and then you submit your transaction. In retail / e-commerce (and many other) scenarios, by "reversing" this process, the payment flow will become less prone to mistakes and much more user friendly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What currencies are supported? =

The following store currencies are supported: XRP, EUR, USD, BTC, ETH.

= Can I use any other store currencies? =

At this moment this is not possible due to the fact that we do not have a reliable exchange rate for these currencies.

= How do I know if my XRP account is setup correctly? =

The best way is to make a test payment, this will check all stages. However you can quickly see if you have any errors.
Also you can see if the trustline button is enabled this means you need to click it and set a trustline.
